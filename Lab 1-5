Lab #5
/* Write a short C program that declares and initializes (to any value you like) a double, an int, and a char. Next declare and 
initialize a pointer to each of the three variables. Your program should then print the address of, and value stored in, and the memory 
size (in bytes) of each of the six variables. Use the 0x%x formatting specifier to print addresses in hexadecimal. You should see addresses 
that look something like this: 0xbfe55918. The initial characters 0x tell you that hexadecimal notation is being used; the remainder of the 
digits give the address itself. Use the sizeof operator to determine the memory size allocated for each variable. */
